# Contributing to AI-Agent-for-Automating-Research

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **AI-Agent-for-Automating-Research** project!  
This repository focuses on building a powerful AI-driven research assistant that automates research tasks, such as summarization, citation extraction, literature aggregation, data synthesis, and more. Your contributions — whether enhancements, features, or documentation improvements — are highly welcome!



## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

### 🤖 Feature Enhancements
- Add new research capabilities such as automatic literature review, keyword extraction, topic mapping, or semantic search.
- Integrate support for new data sources (APIs, PDFs, webpages, datasets).
- Improve multi-modal support (audio, tables, images, spreadsheets).

### 🧠 Model Improvements
- Try alternative NLP models for summarization and extraction (e.g., transformers, retrieval-augmented generation).
- Improve prompt engineering and model fine-tuning for high-quality outputs.
- Evaluate models on benchmark research tasks and add evaluation scripts.

### 🛠 Pipeline & Infrastructure
- Modularise preprocessing, retrieval, summarization, and synthesis scripts.
- Add caching, retry logic, tracking, and logging for production-grade workflows.
- Provide Docker support or environment setup scripts for easier onboarding.

### 📚 Documentation & Tutorials
- Improve the project README with step-by-step setup instructions.
- Add notebooks showing usage examples and workflow demonstrations.
- Create how-to guides for new contributors.

### 📊 Visualization & Reporting
- Add tools for generating visual research summaries, topic maps, citation graphs, and performance dashboards.
